Our project is a side scroller game where you play as a programmer who must traverse
the map, avoiding and defeating "bad coding habit" enemies. The hero programmer can 
activate various "good coding habit" power-ups and abilities to help them reach the
end of the map.

## Base Project Requirements
1. Player can select 4 languages in the start screen.
2. Player can change between 3 appearance styles in the settings popup.
3. (Basic Extension) Player can either load a new game or load a previous game in the game selection screen.
4. (Basic Extension) Player can save their game at any point and load their save files later (see number 5)
5. (Challenging Extension) Player can save and load game data using an online database/web server.
6. Player can see information about a game when loading (name, author, description, icon)
7. Player can select any game repeatedly without rerunning the program.
8. Player can pause the game.
9. The game displays a HUD with status information (ex. score, high score)
10. The game keeps track of high scores.
