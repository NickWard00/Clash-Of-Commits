# Testing

## Strategies

## Scenarios

James Qu:
* Testing for when the upgrade is at max level and user tries to continue to upgrade the entity
    * Sad test case that will throw an exception window saying that the entity can't be upgraded anymore
    * Exception window will be used verify testing worked
* Testing for when the game is won
  * Happy test case that would show if the game is won or not and could be through the game winning screen or other 
  game winning mechanisms
* Testing for when an upgrade is successfully used on an entity
  * Happy test case that would show if the upgrade went through on the character or not and if their
stats increased as expected
