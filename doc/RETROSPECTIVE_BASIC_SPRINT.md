NetID: mw433 jq46 nol3  nw121 mm478


What worked:
Having a break for once in my life
Pair programming is effective, in-person and via zoom
Having frequent meetings to keep everyone caught up as much as possible
Pushing and pulling often and not pushing broken code mitigated the majority of merge conflicts
Our longest method is 24 lines which is very good + we have very few magic values
Got most of our issues resolved by the end
Our game is the most aesthetically pleasing, I said what I said
Our game actually started resembling a game
People working on their issues effectively
People commit pretty regularly and often


What did not work:

Having to film a 20 minute video at a ridiculously late hour on a day many of us were traveling
Having to talk in the video → !!!!! panic attacks are real :(
Communication across different parts of the project (view vs model)
What are people working on, how do different aspects of the code work?
Not knowing this makes it harder to integrate different people’s code with each other
Not a ton of new tests
good overall coverage, but certain classes/methods are way better tested than others
Design disagreements –
where different code should go to be best organized
static variables/methods
compromising functionality for design
Schedule conflicts when doing video
Why did we have to stand during the standing meeting
Need to change a lot of the strings to String.format(“”) etc. bc Robert said so (and make sure you load them in through the labelsbundle properties file)– and make them into private static final String instead of using the actual “string” in code
Comment classes and methods more to enhance understanding about what is going on in this household
Need to update our backlog doc


Our roles are fairly issue specific - we do whatever we sign up for each week.
Level of communication - pretty good! We meet more often than the average 307 team and are communicative about issues/what we’re working on each week.

Plan for next sprint:
Continue working on issues
Focus on implementing attacks and load/save structure
